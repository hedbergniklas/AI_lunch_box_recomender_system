## About the Project

The project began during the recent inflation spikes. With increased costs of groceries and eating out many people have reverted to bringing a lunch box to work. 

This ofcourse, is time consuming. Picking recepies to cook and making a shopping list for the week can be daunting. Furthermore, how do we make sure that we get the best groceries for our week at the best price?

Enter AI-Lunch-Box. 

This application scrapes any of your local ICA grocery stores in order to get this weeks best deals on groceries. 
This information is then passed to OpenAI's chat-gpt together with predefined prompts in order to return to the user a shopping list and cooking instructions. It can also send the information to the phone number of your choice, allowing you to use the information from a handheld device (ex. during cooking or shopping) as well as offline.

This application is unique in catering to Swedish users and tastes but is modular to allow for other languages, units and eventual preferences. There are many possibilities for further customisation and addition of new features.
